# setup
I plan on using this repository as a way to manage dotfiles, configs, install scripts and functionality scripts for my different machines. Currently what that means is a Pop_OS 18.10 install, with i3-gaps, compoton, nvim, zathura, rofi, polybar, chromium, spotify, gimp, and nautilus, and among other software. In terms of workflow, I use my laptop for notetaking in LaTeX, reading textbook pdfs and academic papers, writing scientific and engineering code, CAD modeling, raspberryPi projects, running numerical simulations, and web browsing. Eventually I hope to get this repository organized to the point with install scripts that someone could fairly easily replicate this system.
